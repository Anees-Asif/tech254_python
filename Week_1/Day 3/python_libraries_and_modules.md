# Libraries and modules
Python has very extensive list of libraries and modules. Libraries and modules are crucial components that enhance the language's functionality and allow for code reusability.
They are useful as they allow us to use pre defined functions, saving us time and effort.

* Module - Single file of functions, classes, variables etc, that you can bring in and use in another python file

* Library - A collection of modules. Needs to be installed with pip.

## Example of important libraries

### Math
